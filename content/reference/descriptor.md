title: Environment descriptor
---

The Ekara descriptor is a YAML document fully describing an environment:

* The **nodes** constituting the environment,
* The **providers** where nodes will be provisioned,
* The **orchestrator** that will manage the cluster of nodes,
* The **stacks** to deploy on the cluster,
* The **tasks** that can be run on nodes. 

{{% notice disclaimer %}}
Into the whole Ekara documentation you will figure that the **Environment descriptor**, finally used to build and deploy an environment, is the result of the aggregation of several yaml descriptors. In order to simplify the understanding of those several decriptors interaction we will refer to this first descriptor as the **main Descriptor**, others descriptors will ne named **component Descriptor**
{{% /notice %}}

## Location

The main descriptor is a YAML file, named by default `ekara.yaml`, placed at the root level of a source repository:

```plain
<root>
    |-- ekara.yaml
```

In opposition  to component descriptor the main descriptor is the only which can have a named different than `ekara.yaml`. In the case of a main descriptor named differently than `ekara.yaml` you would have to explicitly pass its name to Ekara commands which you invoke.

## Contents 

### General properties

The following properties define the basics of the environment:

```yaml
# Name of the environment (mandatory)
name: myEnvironment

# Optional qualifier of the environment (like dev, test, prod, ...)
qualifier: dev

# Optional description of the environment 
descriptor: This is my awesome ekara environment. 
```

These properties cannot be imported through a component descriptor and are only taken into account in the main descriptor (see below).

### Ekara platform

The `ekara` section controls the Ekara platform settings:

```yaml
ekara:
  # The base location used across the environment descriptor
  base: https://a.given.base.com

  # Specify the Ekara platform distribution to use
  distribution:
    repository: ekara-platform/distribution
    ref: v1.2.3
    
  # Declare additional components over ones already present in the distribution
  components:
    myComponent:
      repository: my-organization/my-component
      ref: v1.2.3
```

Ekara is based on the notion of [**component**](#components). A component lives in a source repository and is fetched by Ekara dynamically at startup. 
A component can contain a descriptor, always named `ekara.yaml`, if present this componnent descriptor will be imported automatically and merge into the main descriptor.


#### Base

The base location is used to resolve short repository names for the descriptor only.

Example: 
```yaml
ekara:
  base: https://a.given.base.com

  distribution:
    repository: my-organization/distribution
    
  components:
    myComponent:
      repository: my-organization/my-component
```

Will result in using :

- The distribution :  https://a.given.base.com/my-organization/distribution 
- A component :  https://a.given.base.com/my-organization/my-component

{{% notice tip %}}
The base location is optional, if not provided then Ekara will automatically use `https://github.com` as base.
{{% /notice %}}


#### Distribution

The distribution is a special component that is automatically fetched and imported. 


{{% notice note %}}
The distribution is optional, if not provided then Ekara will automatically import and use its [own distribution](https://github.com/ekara-platform/distribution). If you want to use your own custom distribution you just need to reference it through its repository.
{{% /notice %}}

#### Components

Additional components are only declared in the `components` section but will only be fetched and imported upon effective use in the descriptor. 

A component declaration consists in:

* A `repository` attribute for the source repository holding component code,
* A `ref` attribute for the branch, tag or commit of the component to fetch,
* A  `auth` attribute only required if the source repository is private

If a component contains an `ekara.yaml` descriptor at its root, it will be automatically imported and merged into the main descriptor.


##### Repository

The `repository` attribute allows to specify the location of a component. 

The source control management repository wherein the component lives can be public or private.
In the case of being private then [**Authentication**](#authentication) should be provided.

{{% notice warning  %}}
Currently `git` is the only source control management system supported.
{{% /notice %}}

##### Ref

The `ref` attibutes identifies the branch, tag or commit to fetch.

When the `ref` is provided for a component Ekara will first try to fetch the matching **tag** and then the **branch**.

{{% notice tip %}}
The `ref` is optional, if not provided then Ekara will automatically fetch the **master**.
{{% /notice %}}

##### Authentication

The `auth` attribute specifies the authentication information required to connect to a private repository.

Example: 
```yaml
ekara:
  components:
    aPublicComponent:
      repository: https://github.com/myOrganisation/my-public-rep
    aPrivateComponent:
      repository: https://github.com/myOrganisation/my-private-rep
      ref: lagoon  
      auth:
        method: basic
        user: yourUserName
        password: yourUserPassword
```

{{% notice warning  %}}
Currently `basic` is the only authentication method supported.
{{% /notice %}}

{{% notice tip  %}}
If you donâ€™t want to have data such as user names and passwords hardcoded, and the visible into a descriptor, you can pass them through template values. Please refer to the [**templating reference**]({{< ref "templating.md" >}}) for more details.

### Vars

An environment descriptor can defines variables, these variables are intended to be used in templates.

TODO 
- Vars name space
- Vars precedence
- Vars and general templating

### Templates

An environment descriptor can defines templates. 

When templates are defined into a component then this component will no be use as is but it will be duplicated in order to be templated using the accumulation of all the `Vars` content of all descriptors and also the `param-file` given at runtime for example by the CLI or the running environment itself. 

Example of component with a docker-compose which should be templated: 

This is the `docker-compose` where the templating must be applyed
```yaml
version: '3.7'

services:
  vizualizer:
    image: dockersamples/visualizer
    ports:
    # The following line will be updated by the templating mechanism
    - "{{ .Vars.app.visualizer.port }}:8080"
```

This is how the component will specifies, into its own escriptor, that one of its file must be templated.
```yaml
templates:
  - "docker-compose.yml"
```

{{% notice warning  %}}
For performance reasons the templating mechanism will be applied only to the listed files, then if several files should be templated they all must be specified.
{{% /notice %}}

### Providers

The `providers` section declares the cloud providers used by the environment:

```yaml
providers:
  aws:    
    # Name of the provider component 
    component: ek-aws
    # Provider default parameters
    params: 
      region: eu-west-1
```

### Orchestrator

The `orchestrator` section declares the Docker orchestrator that will be used: 

```yaml
orchestrator:
  # Name of the orchestrator component
  component: ek-swarm
  # Orchestrator default parameters 
  params:
    someSwarmParam: someValue
  # Docker default parameters
  docker:
    someDockerParam: someValue
```

### Node sets

The `nodes` section declares the resources on which the environment will run, grouped by node sets:

```yaml
nodes:
  managers:
    # Number of identical nodes in this node set
    instances: 3
    # Node labels for selection purposes
    labels:    
      label1: value1
      label2: value2 
    # Provider for node provisioning
    provider: 
      # Name of a provider declared in the providers section
      name: aws
      # Provider parameters for this node set (overriding default provider parameters)
      params:
        region: 'eu-west-2'
    orchestrator:
      # Orchestrator parameters for this node set (overriding default orchestrator parameters)
      params:
        someSwarmParam: otherValue
      # Docker parameters for this node set (overriding default docker parameters)
      docker:
        someDockerParam: otherValue
```

### Software stacks

The `stacks` section declares the software stacks that will be deployed in the environment:

```yaml
stacks:
  monitoring:
    # Component containing the software stack
    component: prometheus-stack
```

The component referenced must contain:
 
* A file recognized by the orchestrator to be a software stack (like a `docker-compose.yaml` file for Docker Swarm),
* And/or an `install.yaml` playbook for custom deployment.

If the component containing the environment main descriptor is also a valid software stack it will be automatically deployed.

### Tasks

The `tasks` section declares the tasks that can be executed in the environment:

```yaml
tasks:
  task1:
    # The component containing the task
    component: myComponent
    # The location of the playbook to execute
    task: task1.yaml
    # The parameters to be passed to the playbook
    params:
      param1: value1
    # If specified the task will be executed automatically at the specified schedule    
    cron: 0 * * * *
```
