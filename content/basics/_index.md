## Principles

An Ekara **environment** is a self-contained Docker cluster, spanning one or more nodes (machines). An environment is 
fully described in a **YAML descriptor**.

Ekara is built upon two major technologies:

* **Ansible**, which provides automation for Ekara itself and your project tasks.
* **Docker**, which provides containerization with clustering through an orchestrator.
